# SSH Session Blocking Mode Fix Results

## Issue
SSH sessions were failing with "operation would block" errors when trying to create channels for helper deployment and shell sessions.

## Root Cause
The SSH session was set to non-blocking mode immediately after connection, but channel creation operations (channel_session, sftp) require blocking mode to complete successfully.

## Solution
Modified SSH commands to temporarily switch to blocking mode for channel/SFTP creation, then return to non-blocking mode for data transfer operations.

## Files Modified
- `/src-tauri/src/commands/ssh.rs`

## Changes Made

### 1. ssh_connect
- Changed initial session mode from non-blocking to blocking
- Individual operations now manage their own blocking mode

### 2. ssh_open_shell
- Already had blocking mode for channel creation (no change needed)

### 3. ssh_exec
- Added blocking mode for channel creation
- Returns to non-blocking after channel is established

### 4. ssh_home_dir
- Added blocking mode for SFTP creation
- Simplified retry logic (not needed in blocking mode)

### 5. ssh_sftp_mkdirs
- Added blocking mode for SFTP operations
- Removed retry loops (not needed in blocking mode)
- Returns to non-blocking on completion or error

### 6. ssh_deploy_helper
- Added blocking mode for SFTP file operations
- Simplified write loops (no WouldBlock handling needed)
- Returns to non-blocking after upload

### 7. ssh_sftp_write
- Added blocking mode for SFTP file operations
- Simplified write loops
- Returns to non-blocking on completion

## Testing Status
✅ Rust compilation successful
✅ No compilation errors or warnings related to SSH code
✅ Ready for production testing

## Expected Benefits
1. **Reliable channel creation** - No more "operation would block" errors
2. **Simplified code** - Removed unnecessary retry loops in blocking operations
3. **Better performance** - Non-blocking mode still used for data transfer
4. **Helper deployment** - Should now work reliably without channel creation failures

## Next Steps
1. Test SSH connections with helper deployment in dev mode
2. Verify production build performance improvements
3. Monitor for any new issues with the blocking/non-blocking mode switching
